# Ground Control Software

This software is intended to remotely communicate with and control the 
avionics on the Atlantis-I rocket, developped in 2016/2017 by the Student
Organisation for Aerospace Research (SOAR). The software listens for data from
a downlink from the rocket, saving all data locally to corresponding files as
a backup from the rocket. Additionally, data from the rocket is plotted and 
analysed in real time as data is received.
